# Customer Analytics: Purchase Amount Distribution by Customer Segment

This repository contains a Seaborn-based boxplot visualization that shows
the distribution of purchase amounts across different customer segments
for a retail client.

The chart is generated by `chart.py` using synthetic but realistic
customer spending data, and saved as a 512×512 PNG (`chart.png`).
